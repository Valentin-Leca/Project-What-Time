# Project-What-Time
A simple page to find out what time is it where you want.

You can find a city with the input form, click the validation button and get what time is in your selected city.

For this project, I use PHP/Symfony with TWIG and 2 api : https://community.algolia.com/places/ to get all city across the world and https://openweathermap.org/current to get the informations about them.

App available at : https://murmuring-falls-96495.herokuapp.com/

Next step : Create my own api for not depending of the others one.

Another Next Step : Add fonctionnality to comparate the offset of different country or city
